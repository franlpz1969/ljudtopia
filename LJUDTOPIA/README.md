# LJUDTOPIA.com Website Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for implementing the LJUDTOPIA.com architectural services website. The website has been designed to match your provided mockups with the same colors, typography, layout, and content structure.

## Technical Details

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling
- **JavaScript** (vanilla) for interactivity
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Multilingual support** for Spanish, English, and Swedish

## Getting Started

1. Download all the files from the provided package
2. Set up a local or remote web server
3. Upload all files maintaining the folder structure
4. Configure your server to handle form submissions (optional)
5. Test the website in multiple browsers and devices

## File Structure

Please refer to the `folder-structure.md` file for a detailed layout of all files and directories.

## Key Features

### 1. Multilingual Support

The website supports three languages:

- Spanish (default)
- English
- Swedish

Language selection is handled through the flag icons in the header. When a user selects a language, that preference is saved in a cookie for future visits.

### 2. Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes:

- Desktop (1200px and above)
- Tablet (768px to 1199px)
- Mobile (below 768px)

Mobile navigation uses a hamburger menu toggle for better usability on small screens.

### 3. Project Gallery

The gallery page (`galeria-proyectos.html`) includes:

- Filtering by project type
- Lightbox functionality for viewing larger images
- Keyboard navigation in the lightbox
- Captions for each project

### 4. Contact Forms

Contact forms are included on several pages to encourage user engagement. These forms include:

- Validation for required fields
- Email format checking
- Success/error messages

**Note:** The forms are set up for frontend validation only. You will need to implement server-side processing to handle form submissions.

## Customization

### Changing Colors

The main colors used in the design are:

- Primary blue: `#0a2846`
- Secondary blue: `#0066cc`
- Yellow accent: `#ffeb3b`
- Background gray: `#f5f5f5`
- Text color: `#333333`

You can change these colors in the `styles.css` file to match your brand if needed.

### Adding Projects

To add new projects to the gallery:

1. Add project images to the `images/projects/` directory
2. Update the `galeria-proyectos.html` file with new gallery items following the existing structure
3. Include appropriate categories for filtering

### Modifying Content

All content is structured in HTML files corresponding to different sections of the website. You can edit these files directly to update content as needed.

## Server Requirements

The website is built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it can be hosted on any web server that supports these file types. For form functionality, you will need:

- A server with PHP, Node.js, or another backend language
- Configuration to handle form submissions (a sample PHP script is included)
- SMTP settings for sending emails

## Browser Compatibility

The website has been tested and works properly on:

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

## Form Handling

To handle form submissions, you'll need to implement server-side code. A basic example for PHP is included in the `contact-form-handler.php` file. You'll need to:

1. Configure your email settings
2. Test form submissions
3. Set up appropriate security measures (CSRF protection, spam filtering)

## SEO Considerations

The website includes basic SEO elements:

- Meta title and description tags
- Semantic HTML structure
- Alt attributes for images
- Clean URL structure

For better SEO, consider adding:

- A sitemap.xml file
- Structured data markup
- Link to Google Analytics or other tracking tools

## Support and Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:

1. Update content as needed
2. Check all links periodically
3. Update images for newer projects
4. Ensure contact forms are working properly
5. Monitor website performance and make adjustments if necessary
